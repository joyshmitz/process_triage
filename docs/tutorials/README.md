# Tutorials

This directory contains hands-on, safe-by-default tutorials for Process Triage.
All commands are non-destructive by default (scan/plan/explain). Any destructive
steps are clearly labeled as optional and should only be run after review.

Tutorial index:
- 01-first-run.md
- 02-stuck-test-runner.md
- 03-port-conflict.md
- 04-agent-workflow.md
- 05-fleet-workflow.md

If a command or subcommand is not yet implemented, the tutorial will call it out
explicitly and show a plan-only alternative.
