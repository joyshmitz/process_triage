//! Exit codes for pt-core CLI.
//!
//! Exit codes communicate operation outcome without requiring output parsing.
//! These are stable and documented in specs/cli-surface.md.
//!
//! Exit code ranges:
//! - 0-6: Success/operational outcomes (parse outcome from code, not output)
//! - 10-19: User/environment errors (recoverable by user action)
//! - 20-29: Internal errors (bugs, should be reported)

/// Exit codes for pt-core operations.
///
/// These codes are a stable contract for automation. Changes require
/// a major version bump.
